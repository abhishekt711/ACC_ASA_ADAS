The Code for LiDAR based autonomous Navigation including Adaptive Cruise control and Adaptive steering assist is coming soon. The complete Navigation stack includes:

1) Mapping Package: To create a map of an environment using LiDAR point cloud data and the map is stored in PCD file.
2) Localization Package: To localize the vehicle in real time to determine its position and orientation.
3) Obstacle detection Package: TO detect all the obstacles in the region of interest and determine the distance of obstacle from the autonomous Vehicle.
4) Navigation Package: To navigate the autonomous vehicle with the synergistic control of adaptive cruise control and adaptive steering assist.
